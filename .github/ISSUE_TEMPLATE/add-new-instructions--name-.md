1. What are the instructions being proposed?

2. What are the semantics of these instructions?

3. How will these instructions be implemented? Give examples for at least
   x86-64 and ARM64. Also provide reference implementation in terms of 128-bit
   Wasm SIMD.

4. How does behavior differ across processors? What new fingerprinting surfaces will be exposed?

5. What use cases are there?
