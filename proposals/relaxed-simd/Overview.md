# Relaxed SIMD proposal

## Summary

This proposal adds a set of useful SIMD instructions that introduce local
non-determinism (where the results of the instructions may vary based on
hardware support).

## Motivation

Applications running on Wasm SIMD cannot take full advantage of hardware
capabilities. There are 3 reasons:

1. Instruction depends on hardware support
2. Approximate instructions that are underspecified in hardware
3. Some SIMD instructions penalize particular architecture

See [these

for more details.

## Overview

Broadly, there are three categories of instructions that fit into the Relaxed SIMD proposal:

1. Integer instructions where the inputs are interpreted differently (e.g.
   swizzle,  4-D dot-product)
2. Floating-point instructions whose behavior for out-of-range and NaNs differ
   (e.g. float-to-int conversions, float min/max)
3. Floating-point instructions where the precision or order of operations
   differ (e.g. FMA, reciprocal instructions, sum reduction)

Example of some instructions we would like to add:

- Fused Multiply Add (single rounding if hardware supports it, double rounding if not)
- Approximate reciprocal/reciprocal sqrt
- Relaxed Swizzle (implementation defined out of bounds behavior)
- Relaxed Rounding Q-format Multiplication (optional saturation)
